            Rosa Parks protested segregation when she refused to give up her seat
            in the "coloured" section of the bus to a white woman when the "white" 
            section was filled.<br> <u>Her act of defiance led to the Montgomery 
            bus boycott, which was an important part of the Civil Rights Movement.
            </u> <br> After being fired from her job, she moved to Detroit, and was a 
            secretary  and receptionist to John Coyners.
